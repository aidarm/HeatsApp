### This is the chapter introducion

* Describe here the background and motivation for your project
* Why this project, what was the need for the system?
* Overall description of the system
  * What it is
  * 
  in the abstract way our system is a dynamic heating protocol that works according to pre determeind times (timer based) and also according to real time data. the system is in theory implemented in campus so our end users are studemts and staff members.
the system is can work in a fully automatical way once it has been configured.
it requires to type of sensors 
 1. a becon 
 2. heat sensor
the system will read input from devices and according to the control policies (system architechture) will command another device
 1.actuator -  will conect the computer to the radiator.
so the end goal of our project was to decrease energy consumption while maintaining customer satsfaction.

our project is not implemented in real world so as a basic asumption well asume that
  1.all school and staff members are logged in to the app while in school and all has smartphones.
  2.our data is not neceserely obliged to real world the main concept is the app.
