#Chapter 1. Introduction

In the abstract way our system is a dynamic heating protocol that works according to predetermined time sets (timer based) and also according to a real time data. In theory the system is  implemented in campus, so our end users are students and staff members. The system can work in a fully automatical way once it has been configured. 

Two type of sensors are required:

1. A beacon 
2. A heat sensor

The system will read input from devices and according to the control policies (system architechture) will command another device â€” actuator, which will conect the computer to the radiator.

The end goal of our project was to decrease heat energy consumption while maintaining customer satsfaction. The project is not implemented in real world so as a basic asumption we will assume that:

1. All students and staff members are logged in to the application while in school. It actually means, that all of them has a smartphone.
2. Our data is not necessarily obliged to real world. The main concept is the app.
