#Chapter 5. Project management reflection

We belive the project was sucsesful in the way that if we were to pass on the document to a developer 
he/she would make sence out of the documetation and are able to build a software by it, however in our team we diffrintuate about 
wether the fact the we didnt treat all the use cases that we wrote is good (use cases ID : 1,2,3 treat only the admin) ,
but all and all the goal was the write a simple and clear as possible withot being repetative.

* What you would do differently for the next project
* 
for net time we would want o work on an ctual project and it will alow us to work in a more agile way.
* What were the easy parts in the project? What was hard?
* 
for this specific project the hardest thing was the system architchture 
* List here also estimation of hours spend in total and by each member in the project
 25 easy.
