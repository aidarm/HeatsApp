#Chapter 5. Project management reflection

We truly believe that the project was successful enough in the way that if we were about to pass on the document to developers, they would make sense out of the documetation. Therefore they would be able to build a software by it. However, in our team we had different opinions about whether we treated all the use cases in a good way or not (use case IDs : 1, 2 and 3 treat only the admin actor), but all and all the goal was the write as simply and clearly as possible without being repetative. The rest was fine and easy, except the system architecture â€” we have to say that for this specific project it was the most difficult cahpter.

Need to point out that next time we would like to work on an actual project and so it would allow us to work in a more agile way.

Finally, we suppose that averagely each member of our project spent approximately 15 hours.
